So the mississippi governor was like "lol, I want to have the world's largest texas flag" and then was like "oh wait, I'm the governor of mississippi, not texas" and then was all "I know! lets give it to them as a sign of 'friendship' and not 'i forgot who I was in charge of'". Then: "lol, lets give it to them at a football game. Texan's love football". Then everyone in Texas realized they really really didn't want to have it and, like an unfortunate mistake hoping to be forgotten, the flag was packed up and sent away from home to home until it landed with an abusive organization that would routinely stretch it out and display it even while causing it great bodily harm and forcing the flag to get stitches every other weekend. After the next few years, the organization deemed this flag was too broken to continue playing a part in their demonic ritual, and so they replaced it not three years later with an identical replacement, ready to be run, torn, and stitched back together for the rest of its useful time in existence.  This tradition of replacing broken and disabled pieces of culture however would be endemic to this organization as they would casually let a young college student be negligently broken and smashed into several pieces. Then, instead of offering to help with the student's medial bills, they would either duct tape his broken limbs together and force them to continue in their duties, or simply replace them with a look-alike stand in to serve until the next catastrophic accident.
