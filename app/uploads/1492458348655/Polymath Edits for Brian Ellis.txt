Music and the Computational Brain:

How computers can be used to model and aid human musical creative processes

My new proposed field is "Music and the Computational Brain". Generally speaking, I intend to study the ways computers can be put to use both creatively and analytically in the field of music. There are three main topics in this area that I would be interested in exploring:

- Computer-Aided Composition: What current computer science techniques and approaches can be applied to music composition to yield motivating musical ideas? Primitive examples include a composer manipulating a Markov chain to produce a program capable of generating music, etc.

- Composition Mimicry: To what extent can current artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data approaches be used to model the human generative process? Projects by David Cope can mimic Vivaldi concertos, code exists attempting to generate Bach fugues, etc.

- Computer-Aided Theory: How can similar computer science techniques be applied to analysis of music theory? Examples of this include big data analysis of the chord structures found in different genres of songs, analyzing form of music based off of pattern recognition, etc.

My hope is that by taking the following classes, I will be prepared to tackle one, or a combination of several, of these fields for my thesis.
