roll on zylaphone sounds like tremolo (especially higher notes)
-> soft mallets get contact noise bc so soft

if fast and spread out (and not 4 malet)
keys are super important 
-> go look into overtones (and mudd)

5ths and 4ths sound p legit

if too thick, mark what should come out
-> think about what the person will have in their hands
(just about anything works for drums - sticks, hard malets, etc.)
-> if unsure, give a measure or two to give time to switch 

make sure every insturment is defined
-> don't use insturments unessisarily (like one meausre of glock)

change beaters (or way of beating) instead of adding more drums

pitch bends only go like a quartertone (not a full halfstep)
don't write fast bends -> give them space (otherwise lots of contact noise)

don't roll vibes (it's just different) -> not to sustain anyway

-> do the thing where you follow the music theory too
-> write things that are actually music, and not just nice midi
(too much at once isn't really great)
-> Ionization (video in the thing)

bongos-> indicate if hands or sticks or malets or chopsticks or whatever

Poe from pliads

TLDR: keep it simple, but don't be afraid
-> its not how many you have or how much choppy stuff you have, but just how you convey the ideas from you to performer
